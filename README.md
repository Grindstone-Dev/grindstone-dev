# grindstone-dev

A small personal sandbox for experiments, prototypes, and backend-logic practice.  
Nothing here is meant for production — just a space to learn, test ideas, and build privately.

### Currently exploring
- Systems design and automation
- Procedural tools for large simulated environments
- Backend logic for games and world-building
- Workflow experiments and scripting practice

This repository has no public roadmap, no support requests, and no offers of collaboration.  
It’s simply a development playground.
